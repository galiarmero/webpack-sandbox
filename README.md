## Why do we need webpack?

Say for example we have this JavaScript file:
**index.js**
```js
function component() {
    var element = document.createElement('div');

    // uses Lodash but you can't really know in this file
    element.innerHTML = _.join(['Hello', 'webpack'], ' ');

    return element;
}

document.body.appendChild(component());
```

The '_' object used to call `join()` is actually Lodash, a JavaScript utility library. But we will never know just by looking at this file alone. So let's check the usage in an HTML file.

**index.html**
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Getting Started</title>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.16.6"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="./src/index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lodash exports the `_` object which wraps multiple utility functions. `index.js` assumes that `_` exists, and this case it does since Lodash is included in the page ahead of `index.js`. But the latter never really asserted that it needs Lodash.

There are problems with this setup:

1. It is not apparent that a script depends on another library or module. It did not declare a need for them.
2. If a dependency is missing or put in the wrong order, the app won't work. It can't resolve the dependency.
3. If a library is imported in a page without anyone using it, we are making the browser download something it won't use. That's wasteful.

webpack solves these problems. It manages our code and bundles modules and their dependencies.

The example can be found in [ugly-example](./ugly-example).

## Running webpack

### No configuration

If using Node 8.2 or higher, use `npx` which comes out of the box:
```
npx webpack src/index.js dist/bundle.js
```

Otherwise, just use `webpack` executable in the `bin` folder:
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack src/index.js dist/bundle.js
```

Expected output should look not unlike this:

```
Î» .\node_modules\.bin\webpack.cmd src\index.js dist\bundle.js
Hash: 0fb6b5f739b227f489c5
Version: webpack 3.10.0
Time: 372ms
    Asset    Size  Chunks                    Chunk Names
bundle.js  544 kB       0  [emitted]  [big]  main
   [0] ./src/index.js 344 bytes {0} [built]
   [2] (webpack)/buildin/global.js 509 bytes {0} [built]
   [3] (webpack)/buildin/module.js 517 bytes {0} [built]
    + 1 hidden module
```

### Using a configuration

Here's what a simple configuration looks like:

**webpack.config.js**
```javascript
const path = require('path');

const config = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    }
};

module.exports = config;
```

To run _webpack_ based on this configuration, run:
```
npx webpack
```
Or...
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```
It will look for **webpack.config.js** by default. 


## Loading CSS
`style-loader` combined with `css-loader` should be added as **loaders** in configuration.
```
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
```

**webpack.config.js**
```js
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    'style-loader',
                    'css-loader'
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```

When a css file is imported to a module, a `<style>` tag containing the css file will automatically be added to the `<head>` tag of any HTML file that uses a bundle containing the module.

```js
import './style.css';
```

## Loading Images

For images, meanwhile, we use `file-loader`.
```
npm install --save-dev file-loader
```

Configuration would look like this:

```js
{
    test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|gif)$/,
    use: [
        'file-loader'
    ]
}
```

What this does is everytime an image is imported, it will be processed and added to the `output` directory. Below, `Logo` will contain the resolved final url of the processed image (it will have a hash filename). 

```js
import Logo from '../images/webpack-logo.svg';
```

`css-loader` also resolves any `@import` or `url()` to the final url of the processed file. So this css:

```css
.hello {
    color: red;
    background: url(../images/webpack-logo.svg)
}
```
will resolve to this:
```css
.hello {
    color: red;
    background: url(2baa77d6015e6de6adf1ffa247530568.svg)
}
```

**TODO (seek for answers):** How does `css-loader` and `file-loader` work together to have the same final url of the processed image? Who does the processing? How does the other know of the final url?

**Answer**: 'css-loader' interprets `@import` and `url()` like `import/require()`. They will resolve whatever is imported using the configured loader for that specific file. In the examples above, the configured loader for images is `file-loader`. Thus, `background: url(../images/webpack-logo.svg)` was resolved using `file-loader`.

## Loading Fonts

For fonts, it works pretty much the same with images in that `file-loader` is also used.

First, add the filters for font files and use `file-loader` to load them in **webpack.config.js**:
```js
{
    test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/,
    use: [
        'file-loader'
    ]
}
```

Then, define a font using `@font-family` in the css file. We can then use this font to format elements using `font-family` property.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'BUTiger';
    src: url('../fonts/BU Tiger Claw.otf');
    font-weight: 600;
}

.hello {
    color: red;
    background: url(../images/webpack-logo.svg);
    font-family: 'BUTiger';
}
```

As it was with the image, the `url()` directive for this font was resolved using `file-loader`. After `file-loader` processes the font and spews it to the `output` folder, the `url()` will be resolved to the final url of the font (some hash value in our case). And that's it.

## Other loaders

There are a ton of other built-in **loaders**. For XML files, there is `xml-loader`. For CSV/TSV files, there's `csv-loader`. 

JSON-format files, meanwhile, are naturally supported by _webpack_. This piece of import will work without defining any loader for JSON files:

```js
import Data from './data.json';
```

## HtmlWebpackPlugin

This plugin creates HTML files to serve _webpack_ bundles, which may change filenames every compilation.

```
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

## The Manifest

How does _webpack_ know what files are being generated? It maintains a **manifest** to tracks how all modules map to the output bundles.

If there is a need to manage `output` in other ways, playing with **manifest** is a good way to start. There is a plugin called [WebpackManifestPlugin](https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin) which extracts the manifest to a JSON file.
